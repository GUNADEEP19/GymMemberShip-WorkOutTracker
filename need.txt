Design ER with 4–5 entities (min) and correct relational mapping.
Normalize to at least 3NF.

Security and Access
Create DB users with varied privileges; prefer a simple GUI to manage roles.

DB Logic
Implement triggers (with GUI demonstration).
Implement stored procedures and functions (with GUI demonstration).

CRUD + GUI
Create: all tables via the app.
Read: views/pages to fetch data with filters.
Update: editable forms.
Delete: safe deletes with checks.
All CRUD should be operable from a GUI (web or standalone).

Queries required (as per rubrics)
1 Nested query (+ GUI).
1 Join query (+ GUI).
1 Aggregate query (+ GUI).

Reviews (what to be ready with)
Review-1: User Requirement Spec, ER diagram, Relational schema.
Review-2: Tables created with constraints; demonstrate DDL/DML.
Review-3: Triggers, Procedures, Functions; viva on them.
Review-4: Final demo against the above rubrics.

Deployment
Deliver a working standalone or web-based app connected to the relational DB.
